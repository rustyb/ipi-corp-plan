# Consultation Draft 

The Institute is now inviting feedback on the consultation draft of the Irish Planning Institute’s first Corporate Plan which is to cover the period 2013-2017. [Click here to download the draft Plan](http://www.irishplanninginstitute.ie/uploads/files/Consultation%20Draft%20IPI%20Corporate%20Plan.pdf)
 
The draft Plan sets out Strategic Objectives for the next four years. These have been distilled from the inputs of members through submissions, workshops, surveys and interviews, from best practice in comparator organisations, from the experience of the Institute’s Council and past officers and from desk research exploring the Institute’s work and development to date.

We would welcome your feedback, views and comments on this draft by email to corporateplan@ipi.ie or by telephone to 01 878 8630 or by post to the Irish Planning Institute, Floor 3, The Courtyard, 25 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1 by Friday 24th May 2013.
 
The draft Plan will be presented at the AGM in the Guinness Storehouse on  25th May 2013 providing a final opportunity for members to engage with the plan and give your views on the strategic objectives contained therein. The adoption of the Corporate Plan will be a Council function and the first order of business for the incoming Council. This will allow for any amendments on foot of members' feedback.

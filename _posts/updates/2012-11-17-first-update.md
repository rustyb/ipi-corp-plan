### The work for the corporate plan has kicked off!

The Irish Planning Institute has recently notified members that the process of preparing a Corporate & Business Plan has commenced. This Plan will set out the strategic objectives of the Institute and will provide guidance to the Council of the Institute for the four-year period from 2013 â€“ 2017.

We are asking all our Members to engage with the Plan process so that we can deliver a shared vision for the future of our Institute. In the coming weeks, we will be conducting a comprehensive survey of Members (being sent by email on 10th December) and will be holding a series of workshops, stakeholder consultations and interviews.

An Issues Paper and a Draft Corporate and Business Plan will be made available to all Members for their comments, analysis and suggestions. 

The Corporate Plan steering group always welcome any comments or suggestions by email to [corporateplan@ipi.ie](mailto:corporateplan@ipi.ie).

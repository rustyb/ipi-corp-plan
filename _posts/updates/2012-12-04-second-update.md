### Corporate Plan Preperation continues apace

An essential part of the development of the Institute’s Corporate Plan is consulting with members regarding what the key objectives should be and how these can be delivered and measured. The next opportunity for members to give their input is an online survey being issued by email on **10th December**.

This will be followed by facilitated members’ workshops being held across Ireland in the New Year. Members will be emailed with the timeline for preparing the Plan up to its completion in May 2013 and details of the January workshops will be updated here. 

This will be followed by the survey distributed via email next Monday (10th December).

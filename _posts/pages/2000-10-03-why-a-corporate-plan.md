Founded in 1975, the Institute is approaching its 40-year anniversary. At present, the Instituteâ€™s Strategic Objectives are contained in the Articles of Association, the last major update of which was conducted in 1976. While this document has provided guidance to the Institute over the years, it cannot capture the dynamic challenges presently facing the Institute and therefore we require a policy direction that is underpinned by specific objectives, which are linked to a business plan and funding mechanisms.

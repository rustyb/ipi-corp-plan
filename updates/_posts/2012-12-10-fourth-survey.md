### Members' Survey Launched - Closes 21st December

As part of the process of developing the Corporate Plan we are seeking members' views on the Institute as they have experienced it and their suggestions regarding the future role and organisation of the IPI via an online survey.

To begin the survey [click here] (http://IPICorporatePlan.questionpro.com)

The survey should take approximately 15 minutes to complete and closes on Friday 21st December 2012. 

Following the analysis of this surveyâ€™s findings we will be circulating an Issues Paper in January for input. Participation in this survey is essential to ensure the Issues Paper properly reflects the views of members on matters affecting the future of the Institute.

## Welcome

The Irish Planning Institute is the professional body representing the majority of professional planners engaged in the physical and environmental planning in Ireland. Founded in 1975, the IPI now represents circa 700 qualified planners in Ireland. The Institute consists of a governing Council, and a number of Regional Branches and the Private Sector Branch who organise locally relevant events.

The IPI works with both its members and other stakeholders in the planning profession to promote and improve the quality of planning, to represent the views of the planning profession and to contribute to education and environmental awareness in the wider community.

This is achieved through the hosting of conferences and CPD Events for our Members; awarding, recognising and publishing best practice; [making submissions](http://ipi.ie) on behalf of the planning profession on national policies, governance and other relevant publications and papers; and by representing the values of planning and planning professionals in the general media.

### Corporate Plan Update and Workshop Schedule

The timeline below presents the key opportunities for you to participate in the development of the Plan up to its completion in May 2013. 
 
October 2012 - Corporate Plan process launched, background research begins & suggestions invited to corporateplan@ipi.ie

The upcoming opportunities to engage in the process are the online survey being issued by email to this address next Monday, 10th December and the facilitated  workshops being held across Ireland in the New Year. Your participation in the survey is vital to ensure the Issues Paper properly reflects the matters you believe the Plan should consider. The workshops will discuss the areas above, the topics identified in the Issues Paper and any other matters regarding the Institute and its role and operations you wish to raise.
 
The following workshops are scheduled for the New Year. Planners across all categories and sectors are urged to attend but one workshop is targeted at those in private practice, one is aimed at those in the public sector and another is aimed at graduate and young planners.

It is essential that you confirm your place at the workshop you wish to attend as soon as possible. An Issues Paper will be available in advance of these workshops. Please feel free to encourage your colleagues to participate and non-members may also attend.

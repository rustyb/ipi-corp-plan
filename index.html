<p>Town centres are the heart of towns serving the needs of local communities, acting as a hub for commerce and enterprise and representing a significant tourist attraction. The more challenging economic context that we are in now has correspondingly impacted on town centres.

The conference will provide attendees with the knowledge and skills to develop initiatives to strengthen town centre performance.</p>
